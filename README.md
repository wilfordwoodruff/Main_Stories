# Public Stories

Welcome to the Public Stories repository! This is where we store most of the pages and documents that other people have made, so everyone can explore Pres. Woodruff's work in new ways. It's also where *your* work can end up! You can copy this repository to build from if you want to see what others do, or feel free to use our [Template Repository](https://github.com/wilfordwoodruff/TEMPLATE), which has example web pages, apps, and tutorials for you.

## Potential Features

The repository is constantly working to grow and provide additional options for users to interact with and explore the data we have available. Here are a few potential enhancements we have considered building into the current system.

1. **Data Visualization:** Interactive graphs, charts, or maps could be introduced to help users visualize and engage with the stories.

2. **User Contributions:** A submission portal could be added to allow users to contribute their own stories or interpretations, further enriching the repository's content.

Please note that these features are potential improvements and are subject to change based on the needs of the project and user feedback.

# How to Fork a Repo for a Git Organization

## Forking an Existing Repository

1. **Navigate to the Repo**: Go to the [Wilford Woodruff organization page](https://github.com/wilfordwoodruff) and find the repository you wish to fork. Start with this *Public Stories* repository, or you can pick another if someone else's project is similar to your own and you want to borrow code.

2. **Fork the Repo**: In the top-right corner of the page, click the **Fork** button.

3. **Choose Your Account or Organization**: A prompt will ask where you want to fork the repository. Choose your personal account or the desired organization.

Now, you should have a forked copy of the repository in your account or organization.

## Cloning Your Forked Repository

1. **Navigate to Your Forked Repo**: Find your forked repository on GitHub.

2. **Clone the Repo**: Click the green **Code** button at the top of the repository file list. Then, copy the URL provided.

3. **Open Terminal**: Open a terminal on your local machine.

4. **Navigate to the Desired Local Directory**: Use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the location where you want to place your repository.

5. **Run the Clone Command**: In your terminal, type `git clone`, then paste the URL you copied earlier. It should look like this: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO`.

6. **Press Enter**: Press **Enter** to create your local clone.

Now, you should have a local copy of your repository, and you can start making changes!

Remember to always push your changes to the GitHub repository to keep it up-to-date and available for everyone to see and contribute to.
