## You're starting your own project!

You'll want to use **either** the `app.R` or the `index.qmd` to build your story.
+ If you want something interactive or that will automatically update to new writings we find and transcribe: `app.R`
+ If you want to tell a specific story and combine visuals with text: `index.qmd`

Once your piece is published back to us, we'll highlight it in our home page for other people to explore, so feel free to change 
`icon_360x240.png` to something that better matches your project (You can use [Image Resizer](https://imageresizer.com/) or something similar to get the right resolution).
