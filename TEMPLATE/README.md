## You're starting your own project!

First, **COPY** the pieces you want into a new folder. It'll be easier to get your work published if this `Template` folder has no changes.

You'll want to use **either** the `app_template.R` or the `example.qmd` to build your story.
+ If you want something interactive that people can explore: `app_template.R`
+ If you want to tell a specific story and combine visuals with text: `example.qmd`

You only need to use `requirements.txt` if you want your work to automatically **update** when new documents are transcribed. If you do, write the list of packages you use in your work, so we can recompile it as we add new documents.

Once your piece is published back to us, we'll highlight it in our home page for other people to explore, so feel free to change 
`icon_360x240.png` to something that better matches your project (You can use [Image Resizer](https://imageresizer.com/) or something similar to get the right resolution).
