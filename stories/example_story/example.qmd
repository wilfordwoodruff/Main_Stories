# Introduction

This is an example of a Quarto Markdown (QMD) file that uses a Python script to wrangle data.

# Python Code Chunk

Here's an example of a Python code chunk that uses the `wrangle_data` function from the `wrangle.py` script:

```{python}
from wrangle_data import read_data_from_url, wrangle_data

# Load the data into a DataFrame
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilfordwoodruff/Main-Data/main/data/derived/derived_data.csv"
df = read_data_from_url(url)

# Use the wrangle_data function to wrangle the data
df = wrangle_data(df)

print(df)
```

# Conclusion
This is just a simple example, but QMD files can include much more complex code and analysis.

This `.qmd` file includes a Python code chunk that imports the `wrangle_data` function from the `wrangle.py` script, loads the data into a DataFrame, uses the `wrangle_data` function to wrangle the data, and then prints the DataFrame.

Note that this script assumes that the `wrangle.py` script and the `derived_data.csv` file are located in the same directory as the `.qmd` file. If they are located in a different directory, you'll need to adjust the import statement and the file path accordingly.
