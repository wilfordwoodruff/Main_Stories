title: "Location Detection in Transcripts"
---

```{python setup, echo=FALSE}
import pandas as pd
import nltk
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```

We first import the necessary libraries. NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is used for processing the transcripts.

```{python, echo=FALSE}
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilfordwoodruff/Main-Data/main/data/derived/derived_data.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)
df['Current Location'] = None
df['Mentioning Location'] = None
```

After reading in our data from a CSV file, we add two new columns to the DataFrame: "Current Location" and "Mentioning Location". These will be filled in later.

```{python, echo=FALSE}
df_places = df[df['Places'].notnull()]
df_places['Locations'] = df_places['Places'].str.split('|')
```

We create a new DataFrame, df_places, which includes only the rows where 'Places' is not null. We then split the 'Places' column on the '|' character and store the result in a new column, 'Locations'.

```{python, echo=FALSE}
current_prepositions = ['in', 'at', 'on']
mentioning_words = ['from', 'about', 'via', 'send', 'talk']

for index, row in df_places.iterrows():
    sentences = nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize(row['Text Only Transcript'])
    for sentence in sentences:
        words = nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize(sentence)
        tagged_words = nltk.pos_tag(words)
        word_pos_dict = {word.lower(): pos for word, pos in tagged_words}
        for location in row['Locations']:
            if location in sentence:
                for word in current_prepositions:
                    if word in word_pos_dict and word_pos_dict[word] == 'IN':
                        df_places.at[index, 'Current Location'] = location
                for word in mentioning_words:
                    if word in word_pos_dict and (word_pos_dict[word] == 'IN' or word_pos_dict[word] == 'VB'):
                        df_places.at[index, 'Mentioning Location'] = location

```

Here, we iterate through each sentence in each transcript. For each sentence, we check if any of our locations are mentioned. If they are, we check whether the location is a current location (based on the use of prepositions) or a mentioned location (based on the use of specific verbs or prepositions). If it's a current location, we add it to the 'Current Location' column, and if it's a mentioned location, we add it to the 'Mentioning Location' column.

```{python, echo=FALSE}
df_places['Current Locations']
```

```{python, echo=FALSE}
df_places['Mentioning Location']
```
